  <h2 id="what-is-mbti">What is MBTI</h2>
<p>Myers–Briggs Type Indicator is a typology theory authored by Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers, it is based off by Carl Jung&rsquo;s work, for more information, Google it, lol.</p>
<h2 id="test-results">Test results</h2>
<p>Before you scream and shout at your screen that tests are inaccurate, I already am aware of the problems concerning it, for example according to a section in the <a href="https://wiki.personality-database.com/books/cognitive-functions-and-mbti/page/are-tests-reliable">PDB Wiki.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>if you score high on Ne, it&rsquo;s likely you will also score high on Se. That does not mean you use both. The reason being is that Ne and Se are both extraverted perceivers (Pe), so they are going to serve the same purpose, just in different ways. What is likely to appeal to an Ne dominant will also likely appeal to an Se dominant type. That’s because these tests are testing for emergent properties. e.g. “do thrills make you feel alive?” is not an Se exclusive thing, but it’s being calculated as an Se exclusive thing. The limitations of calculation don&rsquo;t account for certain emergent properties being attributable to more than one function in different ways, which is a part of the inherent limitation and risk of getting your type from a test.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However it&rsquo;s a useful tool to see a common trend to assess my type better.</p>
<h3 id="sarkinova">Sarkinova</h3>
<p>Most of the community seems to agree that this test has an intuitive bias, meaning that the rest of the results favour intuitive functions rather than sensing ones, so the results might come out skewed.</p>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/KLFfTsE.png" alt="SarkiFunctions"></p>
<p>Based off the results I have Te most, followed by Ti then Fi then Ni, let&rsquo;s take a look at which type it has assesed me with.</p>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/aSP6oB5.png" alt="SarkiResults"></p>
<p>Te and Ni types first, followed by Ti doms, meaning that I use thinking functions most, just like the results prior suggested.</p>
<h3 id="keys2cognition">Keys2Cognition</h3>
<p>This test according to people is more credible than Sarkinova, so it&rsquo;s going to be interesting to see what results I would get and how close it would get.</p>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/1aY42IW.png" alt="KeysResults"></p>
<p>Just like Sarkinova, the results suggest that I&rsquo;m INTJ, however the function ranking is quite different here, I scored Ti highest, followed by Te then Ni then Ne.</p>
<h3 id="mistypeinvestigator">MistypeInvestigator</h3>
<p>Just like Keys2Cognition this test is pretty credible and a lot of people say it&rsquo;s vague so you don&rsquo;t subconsiously be biased, and it has a slider to be able to answer more freely, this should be good.</p>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/5rSbBs1.png" alt="MistypeResults"></p>
<p>Uhh, well that was unexpected, I scored Te highest, followed by Ti then Ne? then Ni, now that&rsquo;s pretty different than the rest of the results I got. Let&rsquo;s see what type the test assessed me.</p>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/C82EyWG.png" alt="MistypeTypeResults"></p>
<p>Okay, wow, so Te doms first then INTJ then INTP, and all of these types are not far each other in terms of percentage diffrence, ESTJ and ENTJ are different in decimals. Quite strange.</p>
<h2 id="ranking-cognitive-functions">Ranking Cognitive Functions</h2>
<p>So, I will be going over descriptions of the functions and see how much I relate to them out of 10, and then rank them based off of that, we will start with the thinking types first because those are the functions that I got scored highest in.</p>
<h3 id="te">Te</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Extroverted thinking is outwardly conveying thoughts using logic, reason, and analysis. Extroverted thinkers are clear and concise, direct, and unmoved by emotional appeals. They are often strong orators and writers, who have thoughtful, well-researched arguments and theories. Extroverted thinkers like to convince people of their thoughts and implement new ideas. -<a href="https://www.wellandgood.com/what-are-mbti-functions/"><strong>wellandgood.com</strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can easily outwardly convey my thoughts using logic and so on, people have even pointed that out in me, especially in regards to me being clear and concise and unmoved by emotional appeals, and I agree so too. I like to debate so convincing other people of my thoughts is relatable and I love to implement new ideas if it would mean I would get a better or more efficent outcome.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Extraverted Thinking (Te) uses explicit logic, including standardized methods, measurements, policies, and procedures, to make systems and operations more rational, efficient, or effective. This often involves working as part of an institution, be it corporate, scientific, academic, etc. Outwardly, Te delivers opinions and directives in a firm, direct, measured, and unemotional fashion. It may at times be perceived as harsh, tactless, or unsympathetic. -<strong>A.J. Drenth, &ldquo;My True Type: Clarifying Your Personality Type, Preferences &amp; Functions&rdquo;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very similar to the prior description, I have been described as being unsympathetic and or harsh, and I always try to use rational and efficent systems, hence why this website is very simplistic unlike the bloated websites with popups and unnecessary Javascript, I&rsquo;m also writing this using Vim in the terminal, and I do a lot more for the sake of simplicity and efficiency.</p>
<h3 id="ti">Ti</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Introverted thinking is a function that seeks to understand personal ideas using a deeply specified framework. Introverted thinkers are constantly mining their own thoughts in an attempt to be rational and reasonable, slowly ruling out other ideas before coming to their own firm conclusions (and they&rsquo;re often guarded about how they got to these conclusions). -<a href="https://www.wellandgood.com/what-are-mbti-functions/"><strong>wellandgood.com</strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would say I relate to this pretty well, I do mine at my thoughts to be rational and reasonable, as for the conclusions, I&rsquo;m not really sure, I get really firm pretty quickly but I have had times where it took time to rule out ideas to get to it, and I&rsquo;m VERY guarded about how I got there too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Introverted Thinking (Ti) utilizes deep and nuanced logic to examine techniques, problems, concepts, or theories. It seeks self-regulation and self-optimization through the development of personal skills, methods, and strategies. It takes a skeptical and reductive approach toward knowledge. -<strong>A.J. Drenth, &ldquo;My True Type: Clarifying Your Personality Type, Preferences &amp; Functions&rdquo;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, no need to go over anything here because I relate to all of what said here.</p>
<h3 id="ni">Ni</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I once heard introverted intuition described as “knowing without knowing how,” as well as “thinking without thinking.” It’s the most mystical of all the MBTI functions. People with this function tend to reach conclusions without having a clear idea as to how they got there. They are wise, convicted, and always have a plan to work toward a bigger picture and seek to build and understand complex systems. Introverted intuitives are always processing in the background, and regularly have “a-ha!” realizations when answers simply come out of nowhere. -<a href="https://www.wellandgood.com/what-are-mbti-functions/"><strong>wellandgood.com</strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I often get into conclusions sometimes without knowing how, I ALWAYS have a plan to work toward a big goal in mind, and I&rsquo;ve made plenty of complex systems. I like seeing how others have made theirs sometimes, however, I often find it to be awfully made. I&rsquo;ve had answers simply come out of me just yesterday and the day before that, I also get random realizations to topics I was reading days or weeks ago.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Introverted Intuition (Ni) collects conscious and subconscious information, and then synthesizes it to produce convergent impressions, insights, answers, and theories. It sees deep causes, patterns, and laws underlying sense data. It is characteristically penetrating and insightful. -<strong>A.J. Drenth, &ldquo;My True Type: Clarifying Your Personality Type, Preferences &amp; Functions&rdquo;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like with the second description in the Ti section, I relate to all what said here as well.</p>
<h3 id="ne">Ne</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Extroverted intuition often means noticing patterns, symbols, and connections in the world that others may not see. Extroverted intuitives live for possibility, often expressing themselves through a tumble of ideas, or a constant external brainstorm. They may talk about many things they want to do, but not ultimately follow through. For them, it’s all part of the process to get to the best idea. -<a href="https://www.wellandgood.com/what-are-mbti-functions/"><strong>wellandgood.com</strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do notice patterns, and I often have to explain how my connections are being made, I don&rsquo;t agree with me expressing myself with a tumble of ideas though, and I don&rsquo;t agree with talking about things I wanna do but not follow through with them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Extraverted Intuition (Ne) surveys and creatively recombines a breadth of
ideas, associations, patterns, and possibilities. It is characteristically
innovative, divergent, open-ended, and non-discriminating. Outwardly, Ne
users may present as scattered, random, quirky, witty, and ideationally
curious. -<strong>A.J. Drenth, &ldquo;My True Type: Clarifying Your Personality Type, Preferences &amp; Functions&rdquo;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty open-ended and innovative but not random or scattered at all, I&rsquo;m pretty organised like how Te was described.</p>
<h3 id="fi">Fi</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Introverted feeling is a function concerned with authenticity, individualism and values. Introverted feelers know what they believe, have a strong sense of self, and can easily identify their personal experience of emotion. They are often outspoken activists, and love to help those in need. They don’t have stronger feelings than others who utilize this function, but they do have more mastery over them and can put them toward change—of self, of others, of society. -<a href="https://www.wellandgood.com/what-are-mbti-functions/"><strong>wellandgood.com</strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am often or not concerned with individualism and values, not sure about the rest but I&rsquo;m definitely an outspoken activist, not always because I often see it being a waste of time, but I have done activism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Introverted Feeling (Fi) explores and refines personal tastes and feelings, contributing to a strong sense of personal uniqueness. It is self-regulating and self-controlling, working to maintain inner emotional and moral order.
It may also emotionally invest in a limited number of love objects, be they persons, animals, hobbies, or causes. -<strong>A.J. Drenth, “My True Type: Clarifying Your Personality Type, Preferences &amp; Functions”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m very self regulating and controlling, I also often limit the amount of emotional investment I do, but for hobbies I often find myself ditching some I&rsquo;ve had in the past, but I might come back to them at a later time.</p>
<h3 id="fe">Fe</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Extroverted feeling is concerned with harmony, bringing people together, and caring. Extroverted feelers are great at reading the emotions of others; they are big empathizers, absorbing the feelings of others around them to the point that they sometimes cannot tell which feelings are their own. They easily squash and step around conflicts, and they are typically very social. -<a href="https://www.wellandgood.com/what-are-mbti-functions/"><strong>wellandgood.com</strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t relate to anything written here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Extraverted Feeling (Fe) surveys a breadth of human emotions, values, and morals. It strives toward interpersonal rapport, consensus, and continuity. It can also be associated with effective communication and social intelligence,
facilitating growth and transformation in others. Outwardly, it delivers opinions and directives in a direct yet tactful way, often with a sense of emotional urgency and conviction. -<strong>A.J. Drenth, &ldquo;My True Type: Clarifying Your Personality Type, Preferences &amp; Functions&rdquo;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like the prior description, I don&rsquo;t relate to Fe.</p>
<h3 id="se-and-si">Se and Si</h3>
<p>I scored low on both of them and I seem to lean more towards Se in the sense I don&rsquo;t put emotional value to my past experiences unlike Si, and I don&rsquo;t follow traditions or am traditonal at all, So I lean towards being more Se.</p>
<h3 id="result">Result</h3>
<ol>
<li>Te  <strong>(10/10)</strong></li>
<li>Ti  <strong>(9.5/10)</strong></li>
<li>Ni  <strong>(9/10)</strong></li>
<li>Fi  <strong>(7/10)</strong></li>
<li>Ne  <strong>(4/10)</strong></li>
<li>Se  <strong>(2/10)</strong></li>
<li>Si  <strong>(0/10)</strong></li>
<li>Fe  <strong>(0/10)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Based off of this, I&rsquo;m most closest to INTJ, Ni &gt; Te &gt; Fi &gt; Se, which would make sense because I always like to plan ahead, I even planned how this entire blog is gonna be and how it would be laid out and written out prior to it being written, so me being an Ni dom makes sense, especially when I make quick assumptions and also come to conclusion with the most likely outcome than going over multiple ones like Ne.</p>
<p>Te being in aux makes sense because if I were a Te dom that would mean my Fi would be inferior which wouldn&rsquo;t make sense because I do have some Fi. I have values like freedom and so on, and Se would be in tert meaning the more I grow older, the more Se would develop, but I&rsquo;m not in the moment at all and when I grew older I never got more in the moment or more aware of my surroundings, I have always been bad with my physical awareness, but I would say the more I grew older the more I got into politics where I got into adopting ideologies of how the world should be like and I also got into philosophy. So INTJ is the most likely, I will get more in-depth in my conclusion.</p>
<h2 id="other-peoples-thoughts">Other people&rsquo;s thoughts</h2>
<p>These are people I have spent a lot of my time with and have a general idea in typology and MBTI.</p>
<h3 id="jana">Jana</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Sorry if this is awful I’m not the best ecplanainer lol
Well starting with Ni,
I feel like you use it alot whether that’s consciously or unconsciously I see you using it. Like for example when you plan very long term, I mean you’ve literally planned ur whole life when u were 8 11! 1! You use a lot of intuition but why I don’t think you use Ne is just that you think of the most possible objectively you make personal expectations of how things will turn out, I think it’s probably a waste of time for you to think of other possibilities that don’t really matter. You always read in between the lines in a way and predict people’s thoughts or actions which turn out to be mostly true .</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>With Te,
Well first of all your objectivity, you’re insanely objective no matter what. During arguments you can prove anyone wrong because you have proof of everything you state , whether that’s using medical studies, obvious logics or just examples and I don’t see you believing anything without anyone actually explaining it very well. Basically, you place great importance on factual accuracy.I see you as an analytical problem solver in a way, you’re always trying to improve everything and make it efficient. You actually focus on your tasks through to completion.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Fi
I don’t think you’ve quite developed this function enough but I’m sure youll get there</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Well something obvious, you tend to internalize feelings resisting to display them outwardly. Whether that’s not understanding them or plainly not wanting to share them. You form friendships with only a few people who have earned your respect and you have a strong sense of individuality.
You value others who keep their commitments and don’t misplace your trust, you prioritize what’s most important to you in life.
Blablabla basic fi tret stuff</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Se inf
Sometimes slow to adopt new info (not eager to change your world view)
You tend to think instead of do, you might be repelled at an idea at first but you try it out for example THOSE 19198127 TIMES I TOLD U TO EXERCISE AND U SAID NOO AND GUESS WHO’S EXERCISING NOW HUUUUUUUUUUH. You think interaction with the outside world is just empty or unfulfilling in a way.
Under stress you might be prone to excessive sensory behavior ex irresponsible actiond n stuff</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I would write more in the Ni section but my body cannot take this anymore</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="mykel">Mykel</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I think the fact that you use Ti and Te and what I mean by that is that I truly find it fascinating that you can use your own logic and universal logic at the same time it&rsquo;s a beautiful mix. Also it makes sense how we are such bonded brothers lol&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="luna">Luna</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Take it from another Ni dom (who doesn&rsquo;t gatekeep), this guy plays the long game. Sols is not afraid or challenged by the idea of doing something difficult in the moment in order to make life easier/better for himself down the road. Be that changing to a vegan diet and having meals that are composed of the bare minimum (protein and nutrients in a less-than-tasty powder, on its own) or telling people what he thinks about them outright so he doesn&rsquo;t have to dance around their feelings in the future. Sols builds his life ahead of him, and he does it as efficiently as possible (this argument can also be supported by the diet example). When he and I try to read into situations, we both zero in on the most likely outcome based on the evidence, as opposed to our Ne companions who offer a list of more and less likely outcomes and avoid settling.
Deciding whether he uses Ti or Te appears challenging at first, but one debate with him will make it clear to you; his logic is all Te, combined with an extensive memory of sources he&rsquo;s already gone through. Sols references outside sources constantly when forming his logic, and will not take anyone&rsquo;s word for fact without a trusted source to back it up. I would go on, but it&rsquo;s not my blog. Just take it from someone who&rsquo;s been around him for about a year, he&rsquo;s an INTJ through and through.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re INTJ, it makes sense with your Enneagram (5w6 - 514) beepabanpobeppeeepbepep</p>

<p>Well that&rsquo;s what I get for asking an ENFP for an opinion.</p>

<p>It seems that people around me agree with the consensus I&rsquo;m INTJ, and I would agree as well, with everything I do having a general purpose, with values like freedom, privacy and treating people equally, and how I do things based on what my goal is, for example I decided to follow the Keto diet because it helps lose weight, combined it with intermittent fasting and one year later I&rsquo;ve lost 35kg and then decided to move on to Veganism for the sake of health, the environment, and ethical consistency. So my goal shifted and I went with what best fits my criteria and goals, going against Si who would want to comfortably have the same routine.</p>
<p>It also implies Te because I researched the best ways to get to my goals, in the beginning of me doing Veganism I didn&rsquo;t care how much protein I was eating, it was until when I had the urge to get more healthy by doing Calisthenics and  to get a lean physique. A new goal was created and so I started to count my macronutrients, and make get 0.8g of protein per lb of bodyweight, because it best helps maintain muscle protein synsthesis which would help me build more muscle.</p>
<p>So, I do actions based on the regiment if it would fit my goals and the actions itself are backed by research, I have often times had connected dots in ways that are not true to what happened, and I&rsquo;m pretty stubborn when it comes to connecting dots I&rsquo;ve already conncted which is a characteristic of Ni and opposite of Ne which would look over all possible ways, while Ni would instantly go with whatever their gut instinct told them and go with the most likely outcome to them.</p>
<p>Everything so far in my life and actions seem to match with the function stack in INTJ, to being goal oriented, using facts in the outside world and connecting them togther using and Ni with the addition of using research to get to their goals as quick as possible and being focused and efficency which I realy am, as you can tell by the website which has no bloatware or spying unlike most websites, growing up to be more philosophical and value focused and finally not being aware of one&rsquo;s physical surroundings which I relate to a lot and a lot of people can contest to it. So, that is it then my MBTI Type is INTJ. Thanks for reading.</p>
